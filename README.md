# Car Borrowing Dapp - Detail Car Feature

## Introduction

In this project, i have enhanced the Car Borrowing Dapp by adding a "Detail Car" feature. This feature allows users to view detailed information about a car listed on the platform by clicking on it. It displays crucial information like the car's name, description, and an image for a more comprehensive view.

## Why i Chose This Feature

The "Detail Car" feature was added to enhance the user experience and provide more transparency when browsing available cars. By clicking on a detail car button, users can access vital details about it, helping them make informed decisions. This feature aligns with our goal to create a user-friendly and informative platform for car borrowing.

## How the Feature Works

1. **User Interaction**: Users can click on a car listing in the Car Borrowing Dapp to access more details.

2. **Fetching Metadata**: The component fetches the metadata associated with the selected car using the provided link.

3. **Displaying Information**: The retrieved metadata is parsed, and key details such as the car's name are displayed.

4. **Image Display**: An image of the car is displayed, providing a visual representation.

5. **Improved User Experience**: Users can now make borrowing decisions based on detailed information.

## Thought Process

My thought process behind adding this feature was to enhance the user experience. I wanted to provide users with more information about the cars listed on the platform, making it easier for them to choose a car that suits their needs.
